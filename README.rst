Treeware
========
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about - our planet is dying of climate changes!

Since it is unavoidable you need to use some amount of papers to write and publish your thesis, I think it makes total sense for you to consider planting a tree. Therefore,

This package is `Treeware <https://treeware.earth>`_. If you use it in production, then we ask that you `buy the world a tree <https://plant.treeware.earth/pjb7687/uni-heidelberg-phd-thesis-latex-template>`_ to thank us for our work. By contributing to the Treeware forest youâ€™ll be creating employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.
